#  Adex Bank ATM Simulator
This project is a simple yet functional ATM simulation system built in Python. It mimics real-world ATM operations such as:- <br>
1) cash withdrawal
2) balance enquiry
3) phone number update
4) PIN generation. <br>
The simulation includes basic security features like :- <br>
1) PIN verification
2) OTP-based authentication for PIN reset
3) card blocking after multiple failed attempts
4) receipt generation with transaction details. <br>
It's ideal for beginners learning Python like me and also for showcasing fundamental concepts like conditionals, loops, functions, time delays, and dictionary manipulation. All transactions are displayed in a clean console-based UI to simulate real ATM workflows. <br>
Here to be frank, i use chatgpt also but for :- <br>
1) z.fill() method which suggested by chatgpt cause i don't know it.
2) slip_fun() which also i don't know how to code.
3) testing.
Remaining done by me.
